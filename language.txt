Yiddish is now in the Hebrew alphabet, Macedonian is now in the Cyrillic alphabet
Now all buttons can be clicked, allowing phone users to take use the website without a keyboard

The buttons to select site language are now in their native words (french=>français, spanish=>español etc.)
I experimentally added Yiddish and Macedonian [both in latin alphabet]
Redid the internal verb handling code
Added 5th lesson, it doesn't have any grammar explanation in it yet though 
Many random bugs were fixed!

                    <p>Recorded all of the sounds myself, now they are .m4a files so audio will now work on Safari and Opera Mobile. I changed how the front page looks a little. Does anyone even read the changelog?</p>

                    <p>Many glitches were fixed in different courses. Made some very small stylistic edits. Also, the Osage course is now up! ;) Soon I will replace all current audio files with .m4a files so that the website works everywhere.</p>

                    <p>The Amazigh languages are spoken by tens of millions of people across North Africa and the Sahel. Central Atlas Tamazight is the second-most spoken Amazigh language (with around 5 million speakers), spoken entirely in Morocco in the Atlas mountains. A modern variation of the ancient Tifinagh alphabet is principly used to write this language, with encourage from the government. A minority of people use Latin or Arabic but this is increasingly rare, so I suggest you start learning now.</p>

The Georgian language has an easy alphabet, with no capital/lowercase letter distinction. Doesn't sound so hard right?

                    <p>The Fulani language is one of the most spoken in Africa. There are approximately 35 million first language speakers and another 30 million second language speakers. Fula people live across Western and Central Africa in countries as far apart as Mauritania, Ethiopia, and Cameroon. Historically, Fulani has been written in various forms of the Latin or Arabic script, but in the 1980s an indigenous alphabet known as Adlam was created by Abdoulaye and Ibrahima Barry in Guinea. Adlam is growing to be the primary alphabet of the Fulani language in modern times.</p>

                    <p>Osage is a highly endangered language which was historically spoken around the American Midwest but is now mostly taught in the Osage Nation (in northeastern Oklahoma). In 2006, a new script was created for the Osage language, which accurately represents all of the sounds which exist in the language. This makes Osage, alongside Cherokee, one of only two Native American alphabets to use an indigenous script.</p>

                    <p>Japanese is one of these most spoken languages in East Asia, with around 130 million speakers. However, it is also one of the hardest to learn to read. In fact, there are three different writing systems used together to write Japanese- this will teach you the syllable-based system for native Japanese words called Hiragana. Katakana will be on this website later, but I do not know if we will ever have the third system (Kanji).</p>

Presently, Korean is spoken in South Korea, North Korea, and two autonomous counties in China. North Korea has a slightly simplified form of alphabet but it will not be taught here as it is not useful given the current political situation.</p>

                    <p>First update without new languages. Completely redid the table of contents on the top. Fixed a glitch in the Hebrew and Arabic courses. Beginning to add support for new fonts (Adlam uses a new one now). Issues with the delete button fixed- there is now a delete button on number-related exercizes.</p>
                    <p><b>4 May 2021 <small>22 Iyar 5781 | 22 Ramadan 1442 | 8 Jamál 178 | 22 Vaisakh 553</small></b></p>
                    <p>Biggest update yet! Added Japanese (Hiragana) and Arabic, which I am sure will be some of the most popular languages on the site. A section to teach Adlam numbers was added to the Fulani course. There is now a small 'About' section on the bottom as well as a directory on the top. The colors have been changed somewhat.</p>
                    <p><b>25 April 2021 | 13 Iyar 5781 | 13 Ramadan 1442</b></p>
                    <p>Recorded all of the sounds myself, now they are .m4a files so audio will now work on Safari and Opera Mini. I changed how the front page looks a little. Does anyone even read the changelog?</p>
                    <p><b>21 April 2021 | 9 Iyar 5781 | 9 Ramadan 1442</b></p>
                    <p>Ukrainian and Uyghur have been added to the website! I switched around the order of writing systems on the site a bit. Contact me at harrismowbray@yahoo.com with any questions or comments.</p>
                    <p><b>16 April 2021 | 4 Iyar 5781 | 4 Ramadan 1442</b></p>
                    <p>Many glitches were fixed in different courses. Made some very small stylistic edits. Also, the Osage course is now up! ;) Soon I will replace all current audio files with .m4a files so that the website works everywhere.</p>
                    <p><b>11 April 2021 | 29 Nisan 5781 | 29 Sha'ban 1442</b></p>
                    <p>The Rusyn language was added. Some audio glitches have been fixed, but there might be issues on some phones. The full changelog will now be stored in <a href="changelog.html" target="_blank"><i>here</i></a>.</p>
